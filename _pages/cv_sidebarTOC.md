		<h2 id="research"><b>Research Positions & Projects</b></h2>
		<p><b>Ph.D. Thesis Research: Jagust Lab & Cognitive Neuroanatomy (Weiner) Lab,</b> UC Berkeley HWNI (May 2021 - present)
		      <ul>
		        <li>Analyzing sulcal morphology in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and relationships between individual variability in cortical folding (MRI), vulnerability to AD pathology (PET), and cognition</li>
		      </ul></p>
		<p><b>Ph.D. Rotation Projects:</b> UC Berkeley HWNI (Aug 2020 - May 2021)
		      <ul>
		        <li>Jagust Lab (PI: William Jagust): Used machine learning models to generate age predictions based on human structural MRI scans, and examined relationship between predicted age and dopamine PET measures, amyloid and tau levels.</li>
		        <li>Cognitive Neuroanatomy Lab (PI: Kevin Weiner): Learned advanced MRI processing and neuroanatomy methods and applied them to an AD dataset. Discovered several new medial parietal cortex sulci, and found that individual differences in medial parietal cortex sulcal morphology relate to cognitive decline in AD. </li>
		        <li>Neuroecon Lab (PI: Ming Hsu) + UCSF Decision Lab (PI: Winstion Chiong): Analyzed and modeled effects of aging, dementia, and memory abilities on decision-making; discovered that the amount of semantic memory impairment correlates with decision-making deficit in dementia.</li>
