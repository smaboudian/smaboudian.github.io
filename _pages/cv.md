Research Experience
======
* Ph.D. Thesis: Jagust Lab & Cognitive Neuroanatomy Lab, UC Berkeley [May 2021 - present]
  * Thesis topic: Analyzing sulcal morphology in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and relationships between individual variability in cortical folding (MRI), vulnerability to AD pathology (PET), and cognition

* Ph.D. Rotation Projects: UC Berkeley Neuroscience [Aug 2020 - May 2021]
  * Jagust Lab (PI: William Jagust): Built machine learning models to generate age predictions based on human structural MRI scans. Examined relationship between predicted age and dopamine PET measures, amyloid and tau levels.
  * Cognitive Neuroanatomy Lab (PI: Kevin Weiner): Learned advanced MRI processing and neuroanatomy methods and applied them to an AD dataset to investigate how sulcal morphology relates to cognitive decline in AD.
  * Neuroecon Lab (PI: Ming Hsu) + UCSF Decision Lab (PI: Winston Chiong): Analyzed and modeled effects of aging, dementia, and memory abilities on decision-making.

* Research Associate & SURF Fellow: Neuroecon (Hsu) Lab, UC Berkeley [Aug 2018 - June 2020]

* Amgen Scholar: Dranovsky Lab, Columbia University [May - Aug 2018]
