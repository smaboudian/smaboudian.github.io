Research Experience
======
* Ph.D. Thesis: Jagust Lab & Cognitive Neuroanatomy Lab, UC Berkeley [May 2021 - present]
  * Thesis topic: Analyzing sulcal morphology in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and relationships between individual variability in cortical folding (MRI), vulnerability to AD pathology (PET), and cognition

* Ph.D. Rotation Projects: UC Berkeley Neuroscience [Aug 2020 - May 2021]
  * Jagust Lab (PI: William Jagust): Built machine learning models to generate age predictions based on human structural MRI scans. Examined relationship between predicted age and dopamine PET measures, amyloid and tau levels.
  * Cognitive Neuroanatomy Lab (PI: Kevin Weiner): Learned advanced MRI processing and neuroanatomy methods and applied them to an AD dataset to investigate how sulcal morphology relates to cognitive decline in AD.
  * Neuroecon Lab (PI: Ming Hsu) + UCSF Decision Lab (PI: Winston Chiong): Analyzed and modeled effects of aging, dementia, and memory abilities on decision-making.

* Research Associate & SURF Fellow: Neuroecon (Hsu) Lab, UC Berkeley [Aug 2018 - June 2020]
  * Honors thesis: Developed a method for quantifying and visualizing fluency data (and other categorical time series data) using recurrence plots, which improves upon current quantification methods in distinguishing the performance of patients with Alzheimer’s from controls 
  * Lead in designing and implementing a paradigm for prosocial behavior and decision-making in rodent models (in collaboration with the Kaufer Lab, UC Berkeley)
  * Collected, cleaned, and analyzed behavioral decision-making data from dementia patients at UCSF
  * Developed an anonymous test-retest protocol for large-scale survey studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk

* Amgen Scholar: Dranovsky Lab, Columbia University [May - Aug 2018] 
  * Analyzed effects of Alzheimer’s and early life stress on the mouse hippocampus using retroviral labeling, confocal microscopy, and behavioral measures 

* Research Assistant: Adesnik Lab, UC Berkeley [Aug 2017 - Mar 2018] 
  * Developed method to clear and immunostain large tissue samples and performed confocal microscopy
