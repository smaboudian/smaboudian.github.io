<h3>Research Projects</h3>
<p><b>Ph.D. Thesis Research: Jagust Lab & Cognitive Neuroanatomy (Weiner) Lab,</b> UC Berkeley HWNI (May 2021 - present)
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzing sulcal morphology in aging and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), and relationships between individual variability in cortical folding, vulnerability to AD-related pathology, and cognition (using MRI and PET imaging)</li>
      </ul></p>

  <p><b>Ph.D. Rotation Projects:</b>, UC Berkeley HWNI (Aug 2020 - May 2021)
      <ul>
        <li>Jagust Lab (PI: William Jagust): Used machine learning models to generate age predictions based on human structural MRI scans, and examined relationship between predicted age and dopamine PET measures, amyloid and tau levels</li>
        <li>Cognitive Neuroanatomy Lab (PI: Kevin Weiner): Learned advanced MRI processing and neuroanatomy methods and applied them to an AD dataset; discovered that individual differences in medial parietal cortex sulcal morphology relate to cognitive decline in AD</li>
        <li>Neuroecon Lab (PI: Ming Hsu) + UCSF Decision Lab (PI: Winstion Chiong): Analyzed and modeled effects of aging, dementia, and memory abilities on decision-making; discovered that amount of semantic memory impairment correlates with decision-making deficit in dementia</li>
      </ul></p>

  <p><b>Neuroecon (Hsu) Lab</b>, UC Berkeley (2018-2020)

  <p><b>Dranovsky Lab</b>, Columbia University (2018): Amgen Scholars Fellowship
