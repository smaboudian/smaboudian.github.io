I'm a 4th-year PhD candidate in the [Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute](https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley studying aging and neuroanatomy in the [Jagust Lab](https://jagustlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/) and the [Cognitive Neuroanatomy (Weiner) Lab](https://cnl.berkeley.edu/). My PhD work investigates how individual differences in the anatomy of the sulci (folds) of the brain affect cognitive and pathological trajectories in aging and Alzheimer's disease.

Previously, I majored in [Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.berkeley.edu/) and minored in Bioengineering at UC Berkeley; I was a research associate in the [Neuroecon Lab](https://neuroecon.berkeley.edu), where I worked on several projects focused on aging and decision-making. I was an [Amgen Scholar](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/ug/amgen/) at Columbia University, where I studied hippocampal circuitry in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. 

I'm also interested in science education; I'm a campus Steering Committee Member and the Neuroscience Team Lead for [Bay Area Scientists in Schools (BASIS)](https://crscience.org/educators/basis/), a program that provides free, in-class science lessons to local elementary schools. I have also developed and taught neuroscience and neuroanatomy lessons and demos at the [Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Conference](https://eyh.berkeley.edu/), the Bay Area Science Festival (BASF) Discovery Days, and the California Cognitive Science Conference. Outside the lab, I enjoy spending my free time making art, baking, reading, and exploring Bay Area nature.
